git_update_script
=================

Simple script to update a series of Git repository subdirectories in a single directory

Put it in a directory that contains a bunch of subdirectories that are cloned from Git repositories, then run it

It'll look through them all, figure out if they contains a .git folder, and if one does, it runs 'git pull origin' on it.

Originally made for an Islandora Drupal site that has dozens of modules, each of them pulled from Git
